# Implementing-and-Interpreting-Logistic-Regression-from-Scratch
This project builds a logistic regression model from scratch using NumPy to classify binary data. Sigmoid, cross-entropy cost, and gradient descent are implemented manually. The model is trained on two-feature data, and a decision boundary is plotted to show accurate separation, reinforcing core ML concepts.
