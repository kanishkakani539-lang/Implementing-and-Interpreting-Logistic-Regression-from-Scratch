# Implementing-and-Interpreting-Logistic-Regression-from-Scratch
This project develops a cancer prediction system using a Logistic Regression model built from scratch. The dataset is preprocessed, normalized, and split into features and labels. The model uses the sigmoid function, binary cross-entropy loss, and gradient descent to optimize weights and bias, achieving accurate cancer classification.
